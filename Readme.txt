# Streamlit Medical Imaging App

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed for working with medical images (DICOM format).  
It provides preprocessing, visualization, and analysis tools that can be easily accessed through a web interface.  
The app is lightweight and user-friendly, allowing researchers, clinicians, and students to interact with medical datasets without requiring complex installations.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Upload and display DICOM images  
- Apply preprocessing techniques (normalization, filtering, augmentation)  
- Save processed images in `.npy` format with metadata in `.csv`  
- Simple, interactive Streamlit interface  
- Extendable for deep learning pipelines (e.g., MSLBP-CNN, classification tasks)  



pip install -r requirements.txt
